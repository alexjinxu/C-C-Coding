# C-C-Coding
The C/C++ Code implement a two direction Chain to make array sort and setup game. 

For the C version, a fixed longth intger array is used for storage the elements of the array.
in fact, the mainly charactor in C languange version is practicing the funciton pointer list.


For C++ version, a dynamic chain is used to store the elements of the array. 
The mainly charactor is Two-Dir-Chain management.

The basic feature is below. just like a game.


"1- Enter the size of the array                      " .
"2- Enter the array elements                         " .
"3- Sort the array                                   " .
"4- Find a number within the array                   " .
"5- Print the array                                  " .
"6- Reverse print the array                          " .
"7- Print array statistics (min, max, average, total)" .
"8- Delete a target in array                         " .
"9- Quit                                             " .
